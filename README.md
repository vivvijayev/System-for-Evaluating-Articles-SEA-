# System-for-Evaluating-Articles-SEA-

A Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing project to creating an automated system to evaluate essays and articles.
Major machine Learning regressions are used with Sklearn packages and Latent Semantic Analysis is used with NLTK.

We collect model articles from caggle and after prepare the data into a form for modelling and
with that model we compare the articles and grade them based on the score.
its an attempt to reduce human workload and human errors in valuation of assignments, articles, Essays especially 
could apply in Exam valuation.

Gradient boosting regression and Linear regression are the major machine learning algorithms used to train our model.Nltk packages and
other python packages like Pandas are used to clean, fill and prepare and analyze the data.
